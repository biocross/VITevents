VITevents
=========

A full fledged Event Management System For VIT. Student Chapters/Clubs can create/edit events. All Current VIT Students can register for them. And a lot, lot more.

Built on a very experimental Javascript/Node.JS Framework - Meteor (http://meteor.com).

Will fully integrate into VITx, an upcoming Central System of Applications to make life in VIT better.
